# AT89C2051 programmer on the top of Arduino

## Circuit
![image of circuit](/desc/circuit.png)

Relation between R1 and R2:
`R2 = 1.5 ×  R1`

I've used `R1=10kΩ` and `R2=15kΩ`. R3 is pull-down resistor `R3=1MΩ`.
V1 is extra power supply in range 15V - 30V.

Every square connector ◇ means connection to arduino pin. Adjacent to ◇ symbol there is text label (text on the label refers to constant in code). For instance AT89C2051 (shortcut AT89) pin named VCC is connected to `VCC_PORT`. `VCC_PORT` must reflect the physical connection between AT89 and Arduino. `VCC_PORT` (and other constants) value is defined in [VoltageControl.cpp](/arduino/programmer/VoltageControl.cpp). Currently `VCC_PORT = 10` (works for my hardware). Same applies to other constants.

_Programmer requires extra 15V-30V power supply!_

My implementation of circuit using universal board.

## How to use programmer

1. Create memory image in [intel hex format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX) with your favourite compiler (I'm using [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/))
2. Upload memory image to AT89 (may be done sending AT like commands directly to arduino but [helper python script](/pc/uploader) exists)
3. In order to use python helper script convert ihex image into simpler format:
`python uploader.py input_file.ihex > output.txt`
4. Send memory dump to arduino:
`python at89c2051.py --port=COM3 upload output.txt`.
`COM3` works for me, you have to figure out which port arduino uses on your computer (hint: you may use [arduino 'studio'](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to check this out)
